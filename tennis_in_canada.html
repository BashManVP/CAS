		<h1>Tennis In Canada</h1>
		<p>Tennis is a very international sport. When you look at the pro tour there are a few powerhouse nations who produce tons of players, notable Spain, France and the USA. Each country has their own system or infrastructure that has been established to help take players from the grassroots to the pro level. France is famous for their academies for example. From what I have heard, there are tons of tournaments in Spain that help players get battle trained for the pro tour. In the last few years, there have been a number of Canadian players who are making their mark on the tour. Some names include Milos Raonic, Denis Shapovalov, Eugenie Bouchard and a few others. I just want to provide some insight into what takes place in the Canadian System.</p>
		<p>The Canadian System, like many others, is based on competitive play. The more competitions one plays the better they get. Tennis Canada regularly holds tournaments at all age levels. Many adults who were once competitive juniors still play at a very high level. It is the constant competitive atmosphere that motivates many people to improve.</p>
		<p>We have public academies in Canada. There are three provincial academies, one in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia. These academies then filter into the National Academy in Ottawa. The point I am trying to make is that these academies are merit based. It is not the players who are willing to pay the most who get in, it based on which players are the best.</p>
		<p>There are a few completely private clubs that have own internal grassroots programs. However, there are semi-private clubs. Clubs that receive subsidies from the government to ensure that costs are minimal for the members. The rates are quite affordable and act as an incentive for many people to play. There are many public courts that any casual player who is looking to start the sport can use.</p>
		<p>Clubs have sponsorships with many companies. My club for example is sponsored by Babolat. If an up and coming junior is in need of a sponsorship the process of getting that junior a sponsorship can be relatively straightforward since the club already has the required contacts.</p>
		<p>I hope this has provided you with some insight into the basic internal workings of the Canadian Tennis System.</p>
