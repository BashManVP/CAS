		<h1>Building Your Game</h1>
		<p>Improving in tennis can be hard. There are many players out there who play “cardio-tennis” and only want to play the tennis to make sure they get some exercise. If you are someone who is looking to get competitive here are a few of my tips on how to improve and become the player you can be. Keep in mind I will not be breaking down technique on specific shots since there are already tons of resources online. I will link some good resources at the bottom of the page.</p>

		<h1>Let Your Game Find You</h1>
		<p>What this means is really simple. Don’t build your game around what you want it to be, rather what is natural to you. There are many players, like myself, who have tried to build their game around a specific playstyle. There are a few styles in the game such as Aggressive-Baseliner, Defensive Baseliner, All-rounder and serve and volley. I personally tried to become an all-rounder but I am more of a Defensive baseliner. As you play more you will begin to notice certain tendencies that will help you realize which game style best suits you. Keep in mind that you don’t have to fit into a specific box, you could be a hybrid player. In all honesty, you can improve without even worrying about what kind of player you are. The more you play, the better the player you will become. So I advise that you don’t worry about this too much, it doesn’t really matter.</p>

		<h1>Know Your Weaknesses</h1>
		<p>As much as you hate to admit it, every player has weaknesses. You should realize that what is considered a weakness is relative to your game. For example, Nadal is an incredible athlete and baseliner, his weakness however is the return of serve. Similarly, Djokovic is brilliant at the baseline and return of serve but his weaknesses are the serve and his net game. You may be thinking, “but they are so good at the game they don’t really count as weaknesses.” Remember, a weakness is determined compared to the rest of your game.</p>
		<p>How do you identify your weaknesses? Look at which shots you are most scared to hit. It’s all about confidence. If you are in a game and you have to hit a backhand and this runs through your head: “Oh no I’ve lost the point.” It’s probably a weakness. It doesn’t matter how well you hit a shot if you are still nervous you need to use it. If you are scared to hit a specific shot, work on it.</p>
		<p>Other ways weaknesses will be identified is by other players. Coaches will give you pointers if you play in group lessons or in a clinic. You can also ask them after they see you play if they see anything in your game you need to work on.</p>

		<h1>How To Improve</h1>
		<p>You need to have a plan on what you need to do. A common theme on this page if you haven’t already noticed is that you need to take responsibility for your tennis. Don’t go into a private or group lesson and except the coach to guide you through the whole process. Go into your practices and lessons with an agenda.</p>
		<p>Based on what you need, the best ways of improving are different. If you need to work on your technique, private lessons are the best. Though they are costly, they are quite useful.</p>
		<p>If you need a better feel for the game, group lessons and clinics are the way to go. The more “live-ball” rallies you have, the better. You may be asking “Why can’t I just hit with my friends?”. Though that will definitely help as well, the coaches who organize group lessons and clinics often ensure that there are a variety of players. Playing players whose games, you don’t know very well or you don’t know them at all is a very good way to simulate a tournament/ competition environment.</p>
		<p>Some players just need to experiment a little. If you are new to the game or just need to hit a few balls for an hour with any stress, then a ball machine is the way to go. Get a court, a ton of balls and rent a ball machine for an hour or two and just hit some balls. Though it may seem like it won’t do anything, it can do wonders for your confidence and your feel for the ball. If you don’t want to use a ball machine, a wall can do the same thing. I have spent countless hours hitting a ball against a wall. This will do the same thing as hitting with a ball machine. It builds your feel and confidence. If you have a wall in your backyard but don’t have enough room to play with a regular ball, consider buying a green or red dot ball. They don’t bounce as much so are good for small spaces.</p>

		<h1>Improving Your Technique</h1>
		<p>There are many shots in tennis and it's unlikely that you will naturally be good at everyone. If you need to improve your technique, you have a few options. Coaching is probably the most obvious. Get a coach with whom you can do private lessons and who can guide you in your matches. Having a single person you can direct all your questions towards is a great help.</p>
		<p>You can also try and improve on your own using the internet. If you are trying to figure out the right technique for a specific shot, Daily Tennis Lesson and Essential Tennis are a great place to go (links below). They break down specific shots and provide examples of players on tour who are doing certain things well. That is another way to improve, look at the pros. There are tons, and I mean TONS of videos on YouTube of the pros’ practice sessions. There are also many videos that show some specific shots in slow motion. Watching these videos is a great way to learn technique.</p>
		<p>Once you know the technique, applying it in your game can be tricky. If you aren’t doing private lessons, then the best way to apply your technique would be using a ball machine and/or playing with a wall. If you want to check if you are doing it properly, you can record yourself and then check. There are many layers to every shot, so keep in mind that when you building your game, that you only on one aspect of a shot at a time. For example, if you are working on your serve, don’t trying working on your toss and jump at the same time. Get the toss down and then the jump. This goes for baseline shots too. If you are working on your forehand follow through, don’t try fixing your footwork at the same time.</p>

		<h1>Patterns of Play</h1>
		<p>If you are going to take only one thing from this page, take this section. There are many players who see the pros and try to identify set plays. Some players believe that the pros are consciously playing a series of shots and think of them as “plays” in their head. This is simply not true. There aren’t set-plays in tennis like there are in soccer. It’s more of a concept of “patterns of play”. In other words, which shot to play, one ball at a time. If you get a ball cross-court, hit it back cross-court. Don’t think that you going to hit this cross-court, take three steps into the court, take a swing volley down the line, approach the net, and finish with an overhead. Doesn’t work that way. Develop tendencies or patterns on what the best choice of shot depending the scenario. Keep in mind that this takes time. It’s not easy nor simple to develop these patterns. When you watch the pros and you see these patterns, take note of the fact that it has taken them their entire lives to learn perfect these patterns. Tennis is weird in the sense that it’s very easy develop your tennis IQ, but actually using it is a whole other ball game.</p>
